# python_assignment
In this assignment we were given the resources that were two csv datas :One was financial database where we were given the financial records of a company. It included name of months and profit/loss in that particular month.We created a Python script that analyzed the records and we had to calculate total number of months,net total amount of "profit/losses" over the entire period,changes in "profit/losses" over the entire period,and the average of those changes.Also we had to calculate greatest increase and decrease in profits.
Our task was to create a Python Script,run the code and export a text file with the results.
The second data was a set of poll data for a small,rural town vote counting process.We were given Voter ID,county and Candidate names.From which we created a Python script that gave us total number of votes cast,list of candidates and their respective vote counts and also the name of winner of the election based on popular votes.
We did the required coding and commited and pushed it to Github.
So this repository includes two folders 1)PyBank 2)PyPoll .Each Include Python script for the calculations and a Analysis Folder which includes a text file with the results.
